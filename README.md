# React-Native-Mario-Bros

## A game just like Nintendo's Mario Brothers but more "reactive"!

The game isn't functional yet, so check in later.

## Installation

You need node.js to be installed on your computer to run this app. Once you cloned the repository, Use the command line to navigate to the repository location. Then run

```bash
npm install
```

To run it, type

```bash
npx expo start
```

Once it is done loading, press "w" key to run it in a web browser. It takes a minute. Once command line diplays '`web compiled successfully`', the web browser should automaticly open. If not, go to [http://localhost:19006](http://localhost:19006) in the web browser.
